INTRODUCTORY INFORMATION,Immigration Court Practice Manual,"            Since its inception in 2008, the Immigration Court Practice Manual has served as an invaluable resource for immigration practitioners, government counsel, and judges alike, setting forth the uniform procedures, requirements, and recommendations for practice before the immigration courts. Beginning in 2020, the Practice Manual has also served as a convenient reference containing all of the local operating procedures and standing orders that may apply to a specific court or immigration judge nationwide.","            The requirements and local orders contained in the Practice Manual are binding on all parties who appear before the immigration courts, unless the immigration judge directs otherwise in a particular case. Nothing in this manual limits the discretion of the immigration judge to act in accordance with law and regulation.","            My hope is that this Practice Manual will be as much of a valuable resource to the reader as it has been for numerous attorneys, respondents, judges, law students, and members of the general public in understanding our Nation’s immigration courts and the procedures that ensure the fair and efficient adjudication of cases before them. The orderly and timely administration of justice is a critical component of EOIR’s mission, and I remain grateful each and every day for the judges, practitioners, and others who make it possible.","                                                                                                                                                               Sincerely,","                                                                                                                                                               Tracy Short
